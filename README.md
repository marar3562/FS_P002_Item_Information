# FS_P002_Item_Information
It was determined that project 1 had too high of an aspiration. We were concerned farmer acceptance would be low and that the project entailed a lot of work with high risk.

A new direction was formed with more focus on Fair Shares employee knowledge. 

## Requirements - High Level
1. By each produce Item we have which farmers have those items available and we purchase from?
2. What type of Item seasonality do we have for each item?
3. Ability to filter on date range or week numbers / seasons may need to be available
4. Ability to filter on or out specific farmers

## Requirements - Deep dive
1. Combine data from the Food List document into a single Dashboard to help Fair Shares employees answer key questions about our **Items** (specifically **Produce** items to start)
2. Need to provide directions / notes to employees about Fair Shares naming conventions (Ex: what does a Large Squash mean? How do we convert pounds of Arugula to bags? Etc.)
3. Provide employees with Fair Shares':
  + Standard pricing
  + Order history
    - Ability to breakdown by Farmer (who has availability and who do we order from)
  + Farmigo store history
  + Share history
4. Ability to filter on date range or week numbers / seasons may need to be available
  + May even need to be multiple date filters within each chart breakdown
5. Ability to filter on or out specific farmers or share groups
6. *If dashboard successful*, we will remove duplicate functionality in the Food List document
