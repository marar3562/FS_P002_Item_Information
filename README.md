# FS_P002_Item_Information
I determined early on at Fair Shares that I needed a quick way to reference produce information quickly to make optimize the decision making process for farmers. I created this dashboard to answer questions like...
* When is a certain produce item availabe throughout the year?
* Which farmers offer specific produce items?
* Which farmers do we purchase specific produce items from?
* How much of a specific produce item will be purchased by members is a week?
* What are wholesale price ranges for specific produce items?
* Which share groups has specific produce items in the past few weeks or seasons?

The finalized dashboard can be found here: [FS Item Information](https://rmargh.shinyapps.io/fairshares_item_information/)
